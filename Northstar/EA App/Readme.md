## Tutorial
Hey!

This is a tutorial on how to play the Northstar client on Linux with Lutris+Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/Northstar) for Lutris that will set the prefix.

It's based on [Titanfall 2](https://lutris.net/games/titanfall-2) and [R5Reloaded](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/blob/main/R5Reloaded) scripts.

If you already already have the game files install the client first, if not do it for later but if you do then just skip it.

You can do it manually (extract the zip file and drop everything in the game folder), using my auto shell [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/northstar-upllers/releases) or [Viper](https://github.com/0neGal/viper/releases).

Steps:

1. Click + near "Search games".
2. Choose "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/Northstar/northstar-client.json)" and open it. After succesful installation, launch.
3. Changing one settings (you can skip this).

    Settings:

    _Application_: **Enable In-game overlay**.

4. If you don't have the game files, install them, but if you do, EA App has no option to add them (it's possible with [Origin](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/tree/main/R5Reloaded/Origin)), alternatively you can Run EXE inside prefix (NorthstarLauncher), but it won't count the hours played.

    After that the game should be ready to play!

Another way is to use Bottles. Since I don't use it, this video may be helpful: [https://youtu.be/VqDgrHCPWG8?t=368](https://youtu.be/VqDgrHCPWG8?t=368)

Have fun! :)
