## R5Reloaded scripts

There are two scripts, one for Origin and another for EA App.

I decided do bring back the Origin script because it's possible to [disable hardware acceleration](https://www.reddit.com/r/origin/comments/q8o9gv/disable_origin_client_hardware_acceleration/) which uses way too much GPU.

In my case: Origin without hardware acceleration turned off consumes 500+ MiB, and EA App 700+ MiB.
