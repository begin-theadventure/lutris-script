## Tutorial
Hey!

This is a tutorial on how to play Titanfall on Linux with Lutris+Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/Titanfall) for Lutris that will set the prefix.

It's based on [Northstar](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/tree/main/lutris-scripts/Northstar) script.

Steps:

1. Click + near "Search games".
2. Choose "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/Titanfall/titanfall-ea-app.json)" and open it. After succesful installation, click Launch.
3. Changing one setting (you can skip this).

    Settings:

    _Application_: **Enable In-game overlay**.

4. If you don't have the game files, install them, but if you do, the EA App has no option to add them (it's possible with [Origin](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/tree/main/R5Reloaded/Origin)).

    After that the game should be ready to play!

Another way is to use Bottles. Since I don't use it, this video may be helpful: [https://youtu.be/VqDgrHCPWG8?t=368](https://youtu.be/VqDgrHCPWG8?t=368)

Have fun! :)
