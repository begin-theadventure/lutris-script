## [Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/zxvhbu/i_made_lutris_install_scripts_linux_for_titanfall)
Hello.

This tutorial's on how to play Titanfall on Linux with Lutris+Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/Titanfall) for Lutris that will set the prefix.

It's based on the [Northstar](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/tree/main/lutris-scripts/Titanfall) script.

Steps:

1. Click + near "Search games".

2. Choose "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/Titanfall/titanfall-steam-origin.json)" and open it.

    When installing p0358's Origin patch make sure to click on "Pretend EA App is installed (so that Steam does not start its installer)" to be able to launch with Steam.

    Remember to install Origin first, and the patch afterward.

    After successful installation, click Launch.

3. Changing settings to save resources and other stuff (not necessary).

    In Origin:

    To disable **hardware acceleration**, which in my case uses 500+ MiB of GPU (!), see this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/origin/comments/q8o9gv/disable_origin_client_hardware_acceleration). In our case, the directory is /path/to/titanfall/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Origin/platforms

    Origin->Applications Settings:

    _Application_: Client update - all off, Start-up options_ - all off.

    _Help improve Origin_: Diagnostics - all off.

    _Origin in-game_: **Enable Origin In-Game**.

    Lutris->â–²->Run EXE..->drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steam.exe.

    Log in to Steam. I couldn't log in with the QR code, so I used my login and password. A restart may be needed.

    I like to change these settings in Steam->Settings:

    _Friends_: Sign in to friends when Steam Client starts

    _In-Game_: **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game**.

    _Interface_: Notify me about.., Start Up Location.. - Library, Start Steam in Big Picture Mode, **Enable GPU accelerated**.. & **Enable hardware video**..

    _Library_: Low Bandwith Mode, Low Performance Mode & Disable Community Content.

    I recommend using Steam in Big Picture mode.

    Launch options:

    Lutris->right click on the banner->Configure->Game options->`+open steam://open/minigameslist` opens the mini-games list and `steam://rungameid/1454890` launches the game automatically.

4. If you don't have the game files, install them via Steam, but if you do, you can add them:

    To add the game, move `appmanifest_1454890.acf` + `appmanifest_228980.acf` (by default in ~/.local/share/Steam) to /path/to/titanfall/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps and symlink `Titanfall` + `Steamworks Shared` to `common` in the same folder.

Add the game to favorites to make it easier to choose, play, agree to EULA, Steam will install the necessary stuff, and the game should be ready to play!

Have fun! :)
