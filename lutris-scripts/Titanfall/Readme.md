## Titanfall scripts

#### Crash
If the game doesn't start (crashes) at startup, use [DXVK-async](https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async/releases/tag/1.10.3) 1.10.3 or [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.3) 1.10.3.

With this version, also use my [.dxvk-cache](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/dxvk-caches/tree/v10/dxvk-caches/Titanfall/Titanfall) (for less stuttering). Download, extract and move it to /path/to/titanfall/dxvk-cache

#### Mod
I recommend installing p0358's enhancement mod, [Black Market Edition](https://github.com/p0358/black_market_edition#readme) (BME). You can get it with [this link](https://tf-bme.s3.eu-central-003.backblazeb2.com/versions/1b9/bme_installer.exe), [proof](https://github.com/p0358/black_market_edition/blob/db821b6e19997091a69d9c787223a7802a8beb80/bmedll/Updater.cpp#L41).

To install: â–²->Run EXE inside Wine prefix
