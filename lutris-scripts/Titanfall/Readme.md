## Titanfall scripts

If the game doesn't start (crashes) at startup, use [DXVK-async](https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async/releases/tag/1.10.3) 1.10.3 or [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.3) 1.10.3.

With this version, also use my [.dxvk-cache](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/dxvk-caches/tree/v10/dxvk-caches/Titanfall/Titanfall) (for less stuttering). Download, extract and move it to /path/to/titanfall/dxvk-cache
