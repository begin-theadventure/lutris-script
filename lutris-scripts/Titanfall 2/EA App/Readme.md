## [Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/zxvhbu/i_made_lutris_install_scripts_linux_for_titanfall)
Hello.

This tutorial's on how to play Titanfall 2 on Linux with Lutris+Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/Titanfall-2) for Lutris that will set the prefix.

It's based on [Titanfall 2](https://lutris.net/games/titanfall-2), the [EA App](https://lutris.net/games/ea-desktop) scripts and this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/qhq3pn/ea_desktop_finally_working).

Steps:

1. Click + near "Search games".

2. Choose "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/Titanfall-2/titanfall-2-ea-app.json)" and open it. After successful installation, click Launch.

3. Changing one setting (not necessary).

    Settings:

    _Application_: **Enable In-game overlay**.

4. If you don't have the game files, install them, but if you do, check out this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/5HCQYtuzqgk?t=15).

After that, the game should be ready to play!

Have fun! :)
