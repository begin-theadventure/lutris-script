## Tutorial
Hey!

This is a tutorial on how to play Titanfall 2 on Linux with Lutris+Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/Titanfall-2) for Lutris that will set the prefix.

It's based on [Titanfall 2](https://lutris.net/games/titanfall-2), the [EA App](https://lutris.net/games/ea-desktop) scripts and this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/qhq3pn/ea_desktop_finally_working).

Steps:

1. Click + near "Search games".
2. Choose "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/Titanfall-2/titanfall-2-ea-app.json)" and open it. After succesful installation, click Launch.
3. Changing one setting (you can skip this).

    Settings:

    _Application_: **Enable In-game overlay**.

4. If you don't have the game files, install them, but if you do, the EA App has no option to add them.

    After that the game should be ready to play!

Have fun! :)
