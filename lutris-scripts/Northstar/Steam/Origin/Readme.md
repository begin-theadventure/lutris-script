## Tutorial
_Before see [this Twitter post](https://twitter.com/p0358/status/1626811868412010497). You will also have to exit EA App installer after launching the game._

Hello.

This is a tutorial on how to play the Northstar client on Linux with Lutris+Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/Northstar) for Lutris that will set the prefix.

It's based on [Titanfall 2](https://lutris.net/games/titanfall-2) and [Origin](https://lutris.net/games/origin) scripts.

If you already have the game files install the client first, if not then skip it and do it after installing the game.

You can do it manually (extract the [zip file](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) and drop everything in the game folder), using my automatic [shell scripts](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/northstar-upllers/releases) or [Viper](https://github.com/0neGal/viper/releases).

Steps:

1. Click + near "Search games".
2. Choose "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/Northstar/northstar-client-steam-origin.json)" and open it. After succesful installation, launch.
3. Changing settings to save resources and other stuff (you can skip this).

    Log in to Steam. I couldn't log in with the QR code, so I used my login and password. A restart may be needed.

    Personally, I like to change these settings in Steam->Settings:

    _Friends_: Automatically sign into..

    _In-Game_: **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game**.

    _Interface_: Notify me about.., Select which window.. - Library, **Enable GPU accelerated**.. & **Enable hardware video**..

    _Library_: Low Bandwith Mode & Low Performance Mode.

    Launch options:

    Lutris->right click on the banner->Configure->Game options->`-no-browser` saves resouces (albeit resulting in fewer features, including Properties), `+open steam://open/minigameslist` opens the mini-games list and `steam://rungameid/1237970` launches the game automatically->Re-open.

    And also in Origin:

    To disable **hardware acceleration**, which in my case uses 500+ MiB of GPU (!) see this Reddit post, [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/origin/comments/q8o9gv/disable_origin_client_hardware_acceleration). In our case, the directory is /path/to/northstar-client/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Origin/platforms

    Lutris->â–²->Run EXE..->drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Origin Origin.exe and log in.

    Origin->Applications Settings:

    _Application_: Client update - all off, Start-up options_ - all off.

    _Help improve Origin_: Diagnostics - all off.

    _Origin in-game_: **Enable Origin In-Game**.

    Now exit Steam & Origin.

4. If you don't have the game files, install via Steam, but if you do, you can add them:

    To add the game move `appmanifest_1237970.acf` + `appmanifest_228980.acf` (by default in ~/.local/share/Steam) to /path/to/northstar-client/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam and symlink `Titanfall2` + `Steamworks Shared` to `common` in the same folder.

    Open Steam and now Titanfall 2 will be in your library!

5. In the Titanfall2 folder, create a file `run_northstar.txt` and type `1` in it ([source](https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarLauncher/pull/19)).

    After that, add the game to favorites to make it easier to choose, play, agree to the EULA, Steam will install the necessary stuff and the game should be ready to play!
