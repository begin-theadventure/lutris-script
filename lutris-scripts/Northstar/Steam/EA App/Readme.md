## Tutorial
Hey!

This is a tutorial on how to play the Northstar client on Linux with Lutris+Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/Northstar) for Lutris that will set the prefix.

It's based on [Titanfall 2](https://lutris.net/games/titanfall-2), the [EA App](https://lutris.net/games/ea-desktop) scripts and this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/qhq3pn/ea_desktop_finally_working).

If you already have the game files install the client first, if not then skip it and do it after installing the game.

You can do it manually (extract the [zip file](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar/releases) and drop everything in the game folder), using my auto shell [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/northstar-upllers/releases) or [Viper](https://github.com/0neGal/viper/releases).

Steps:

1. Click + near "Search games".
2. Choose "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/Northstar/northstar-client-steam-ea-app.json)" and open it. After succesful installation, launch.
3. Changing settings to save resources and some bugs (you can skip this).

    Log in to Steam. I couldn't log in with the QR code, so I used my login and password. A restart may be needed.

    Running Steam with these arguments will have a less buggy GUI, and may save more resources (albeit -no-browser means fewer features, including Properties):

    Lutris->right click on the banner->Configure->Game options->`-no-browser +open steam://open/minigameslist`->Re-open.

    Personally, I like to change these settings in Steam->Settings:

    _Friends_: Automatically sign into..

    _In-Game_: **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game**.

    _Interface_: Notify me about.., Select which window.. - Library, **Enable GPU accelerated**.. & **Enable hardware video**..

    _Library_: Low Bandwith Mode & Low Performance Mode.

    In the EA App:

    Lutris->â–²->Run EXE..->drive_c/Program Files/Electronics Arts/EA Desktop/EA Desktop EADesktop.exe and log in.

    Settings:

    _Application_: **Enable In-game overlay**.

    Now exit Steam & the EA App.

4. If you don't have the game files, install via Steam, but if you do, you can add them:

    To add the game move `appmanifest_1237970.acf` + `appmanifest_228980.acf` (by default in ~/.local/share/Steam) to /path/to/northstar-client/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam and symlink `Titanfall2` + `Steamworks Shared` to `common` in the same folder.

    Open Steam and now Titanfall 2 will be in your library!

[5.](https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarLauncher/pull/19)In the Titanfall2 folder, create a file `run_northstar.txt` and type `1` in it.

    After that, add the game to favorites to make it easier to choose, play, agree to the EULA, Steam will install the necessary stuff and the game should be ready to play!
