## [Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/r5reloaded/comments/wv19jf/r5reloaded_works_on_linux_v2)
Hello.

This tutorial is on how to play R5Reloaded on Linux with Lutris + Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/R5Reloaded) for Lutris, which will set the prefix.

It's based on [Apex Legends](https://lutris.net/games/apex-legends) and [EA app](https://lutris.net/games/ea-desktop) scripts, as well as this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/qhq3pn/ea_desktop_finally_working).

Steps:

0. Use an _alt account_ just in case of a ban (better be careful).

1. Click `+` (Add Game) on the left side of the top bar.

2. Choose "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/R5Reloaded/r5reloaded-ea-app.json)".

    R5Reloaded Installer: Next -> Install -> Close

    After a successful installation, click Launch.

3. Click "Install Apex" in the launcher.

    After installing, click "Launch Apex" and log in to the EA app.

    And then: Search games and add-ons -> Apex Legends -> DOWNLOAD -> CANCEL (this will add the game to the library)

Launch Apex (with the R5Reloaded launcher)

4. EA app settings (optional).

    â‰¡ -> Settings:

    _My account_: Privacy Usage sharing - off

    _Application_: Application updates, Enable background service, and In-game overlay } off
