## R5Reloaded scripts

There are two scripts for Origin and the EA App.

Why is there a script for Origin? Because it's possible to [disable hardware acceleration](https://www.reddit.com/r/origin/comments/q8o9gv/disable_origin_client_hardware_acceleration) which uses way too much GPU.

In my case: Origin without hardware acceleration turned off consumes 500+ MiB, and the EA App 700+ MiB.

Origin also has an option to locate the game, while the EA App doesn't.
