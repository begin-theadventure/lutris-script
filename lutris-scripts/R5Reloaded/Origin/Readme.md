## [Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/r5reloaded/comments/wv19jf/r5reloaded_works_on_linux_v2)
Hello.

This tutorial is on how to play R5Reloaded on Linux with Lutris + Wine.

I made a [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/tag/R5Reloaded) for Lutris, which will set the prefix.

It's based on [Apex Legends](https://lutris.net/games/apex-legends) and [Origin](https://lutris.net/games/origin) scripts.

Steps:

0. Use an _alt account_ just in case of a ban (better be careful).

1. Click `+` (Add Game) on the left side of the top bar.

2. "Install from a local install [script](https://github.com/begin-theadventure/lutris-scripts/releases/download/R5Reloaded/r5reloaded-origin.json)" -> Script File `:` (Select a File) -> Install, Install, Continue, Install.

    Install Origin first, and the patch afterward.

    R5Reloaded installer: Next -> Install -> Close.

    After a successful installation, click Launch.

3. Click "Install Apex" in the launcher.

    After installing, click "Launch Apex" and log in to Origin.

    And then: Search games and more -> Apex Legends -> Add to Library

Launch Apex (with the R5Reloaded launcher)

4. Change settings to save resources, etc. (optional).

    To disable **hardware acceleration**, which in my case can use 500+ MiB of GPU, see this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/origin/comments/q8o9gv/disable_origin_client_hardware_acceleration). In our case, the directory is /path/to/`r5reloaded/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Origin/platforms`

    Origin -> Applications Settings:

    _Application_: Client update, and Start-up options } off

    _Diagnostics_: Help improve Origin } off

    _Origin in-game_: Enable Origin In-Game - off
